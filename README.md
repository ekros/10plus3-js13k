# 10 plus 3

10 plus 3 is a math puzzle game for the 2024 edition of the 13kjsgames competition. This year's theme is Triskaidekaphobia.

The mechanics are simple. 

You have a starting number in the center. Select the operations using the arrow keys in the correct order to get the number... 13!

Hopefully it will help with your phobia!

(Don't try to finish the game... levels are generated so it would never end :))
